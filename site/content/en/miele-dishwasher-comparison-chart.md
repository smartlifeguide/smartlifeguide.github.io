## Installation and Maintenance Tips for Your Miele Dishwasher

Investing in a Miele dishwasher in 2026 is a smart choice, and proper installation and ongoing maintenance will ensure it performs flawlessly for its entire lifespan.

### Professional Installation is Key

While some DIY enthusiasts might consider installing a dishwasher themselves, for a Miele, professional installation is highly recommended.

*   **Precision Matters:** Miele dishwashers are engineered with precision, and proper leveling, water connections, and electrical hook-ups are crucial for optimal performance, quiet operation, and preventing leaks.
*   **Warranty Protection:** Incorrect installation can void your warranty. A certified Miele installer will ensure everything is done to specification.
*   **Integrated Models:** Fully integrated models require careful panel alignment for a seamless kitchen look, which is best left to experienced professionals.

### Essential Maintenance for Longevity

Miele appliances are built to last, but a little care goes a long way.

1.  **Clean the Filters Regularly:** The filter system in the base of your dishwasher should be checked and cleaned weekly or bi-weekly, depending on usage. This prevents food particles from recirculating and causing odors or blockages.
2.  **Use Miele-Recommended Detergents and Rinse Aid:** For AutoDos models, stick with Miele's PowerDisk. For manual dispensing, Miele's detergents and rinse aid are formulated to work perfectly with their machines, optimizing cleaning and drying.
3.  **Check Salt Levels (if applicable):** If your model has a water softener, ensure you keep the special dishwasher salt topped up, especially if you live in a hard water area. This prevents limescale buildup and maintains cleaning efficacy.
4.  **Run a Maintenance Cycle:** Periodically (e.g., every 3-6 months), run an empty cycle with a dedicated dishwasher cleaner or a high-temperature program to deep clean the interior and pipes.
5.  **Clean the Spray Arms:** Occasionally, check the spray arms for clogged nozzles and clean them out to ensure an even spray pattern.
6.  **Wipe Down the Door Seal:** Prevent mold and mildew buildup by regularly wiping the rubber door seal with a damp cloth.

<div class="warning-box en">
<p>Always use high-quality, Miele-compatible detergents and rinse aid. Using incorrect or low-quality products can lead to poor cleaning results, damage to your dishwasher, and potential warranty issues.</p>
