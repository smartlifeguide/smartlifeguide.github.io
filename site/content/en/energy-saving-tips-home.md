*   **Insulate Your Tank:** If you have an older tank-style water heater, insulating it with a water heater blanket can reduce heat loss by 25-45%, saving you 7-16% on water heating costs annually.
*   **Insulate Pipes:** Insulating the first six feet of hot and cold water pipes connected to your water heater can reduce heat loss and raise water temperature by 2-4°F, allowing for a lower thermostat setting.
*   **Consider Tankless Water Heaters:** If you're due for a replacement, tankless (on-demand) water heaters heat water only when you need it, eliminating standby energy losses. While they have a higher upfront cost, they can be 24-34% more energy-efficient than conventional storage tank water heaters for an average family.

### 5.2 Smart Water Habits & Fixtures

Even without major appliance upgrades, daily habits can make a big difference.

*   **Shorter Showers:** Aim for quicker showers. Every minute counts!
*   **Low-Flow Fixtures:** Install low-flow showerheads and faucet aerators. These devices restrict water flow without compromising pressure, saving both water and the energy needed to heat it.
*   **Full Loads Only:** Run your dishwasher and washing machine only when they are full.
*   **Fix Leaks:** A dripping faucet can waste thousands of gallons of water (and the energy to heat it) over a year. Fix leaks promptly.
